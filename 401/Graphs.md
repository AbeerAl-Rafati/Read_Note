# Graphs     
A graph is a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of vertices (or nodes) potentially connected by line segments named edges.    



- Undirected Graphs    
An Undirected Graph is a graph where each edge is undirected or bi-directional. This means that the undirected graph does not move in any direction.    

- Directed Graphs (Digraph)    
A Directed Graph also called a Digraph is a graph where every edge is directed. Digraph has direction. Each node is directed at another node with a specific requirement of what node should be referenced next.    

- Complete Graphs   
A complete graph is when all nodes are connected to all other nodes.    

- Connected    
A connected graph is graph that has all of vertices/nodes have at least one edge.     

- Disconnected    
A disconnected graph is a graph where some vertices may not have edges.    

- Acyclic Graph   
An acyclic graph is a directed graph without cycles. A cycle is when a node can be traversed through and potentially end up back at itself.   

- Cyclic Graphs    
A Cyclic graph is a graph that has cycles. A cycle is defined as a path of a positive length that starts and ends at the same vertex.    

- Graph Representation   
We represent graphs through:   
1. Adjacency Matrix
An Adjacency matrix is represented through a 2-dimensional array. If there are n vertices, then we are looking at an n x n Boolean matrix     

2. Adjacency List
An adjacency list is the most common way to represent graphs.   

- Weighted Graphs    
A weighted graph is a graph with numbers assigned to its edges. These numbers are called weights.
