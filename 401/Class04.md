## Review  

*Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development*  
- Save project costs in the long run.   
- Better program design and higher code quality   
- Detailed project documentation   

*In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?*  
when we need to mock the real server work  with

*What is one downside of Test Driven Development*  
The strongest argument against TDD is that the tests need to be maintained because the code has got to.   


*What’s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?*  
inheritance 

*Why REST?*   
REST can handle multiple types of calls, return different data   



## Vocabulary

| functional programming |  is the process of building software by composing pure functions, avoiding shared state, mutable data, and side-effects.
| object-oriented programming (OOP)| computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. 
|class| template for creating objects
|super | It is used to call the constructor of the parent class and to access the parent's properties and methods.

| Test Driven Development | software development approach in which test cases are developed to specify and validate what the code will do.    
| Jest | JavaScript testing framework designed to ensure correctness of any JavaScript codebase.

## Preparation Materials


> nosql vs sql   

| SQL | NoSQL | 
|-----|-------|
| Relational Databases (RDBMS) | non-relational or distributed database.  |
|table based databases|document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores|
| predefined schema|dynamic schema|
|vertically scalable|horizontally scalable|
|uses SQL|focused on collection of documents|

**SQL Database Examples**   
- MySQL Community Edition
- MS-SQL Server Express Edition   
- Oracle Express Edition   


**NoSQL Database Examples**

- MongoDB 
- CouchDB   
- Redis

> nosql modeling techniques  

- Relational modeling is typically driven by the structure of available data.   
- NoSQL data modeling is typically driven by application-specific access patterns   
- NoSQL data modeling often requires a deeper understanding of data structures and algorithms than relational database modeling does.   
- Relational databases are not very convenient for hierarchical or graph-like data modeling and processing.   

**Conceptual and General and hierarchy Techniques**   


(1) Denormalization   
(2) Aggregates   
(3) Application Side Joins   

*General Techniques*    
(4) Atomic Aggregates
(5) Enumerable Keys   
(6) Dimensionality Reduction   
(7) Index Table   
(8) Composite Key Index   
(9) Aggregation with Composite Keys   
(10) Inverted Search – Direct Aggregation   

*hierarchy Techniques*
(11) Tree Aggregation   
(12) Adjacency Lists   
(13) Materialized Paths   
(14) Nested Sets   
(15) Nested Documents Flattening(Numbered Field Names)
