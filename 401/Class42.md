## Ethics in the workplace
> Google and AI   

I think that ensuring that technology and areas of artificial intelligence are not used in military operations or ensuring that they are not used to penetrate the privacy of people in society is a figment of the imagination, just like saying that stimulating nuclear reactors is not dangerous, perhaps AI is more dangerous as it can affect everyone in society in particular

## Ethics in Technology
> Self Driving Car Ethics    

Despite the long debate about the morality of using self-driving cars, the reality says that they will inevitably be used. For myself, I really like this idea. I think that any work that a machine can do in general, a person should not waste his time in completing it, saying that it will definitely be more accurate and faster. and will let people devote themselves to things that only their human spirit can accomplish.
