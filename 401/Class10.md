## Stacks and Queues   

**Stack**  
A stack is a data structure that consists of Nodes. Each Node references the next Node in the stack, but does not reference its previous.  


*Push* - Nodes or items that are put into the stack are pushed  
*Pop* - Nodes or items that are removed from the stack are popped  
*Top* - This is the top of the stack.  
*Peek* - When you peek you will view the value of the top Node in the stack.  
*IsEmpty* - returns true when stack is empty otherwise returns false.

**What is a Queue**   


*nqueue* - Nodes or items that are added to the queue.  
*Dequeue* - Nodes or items that are removed from the queue.   
*Front* - This is the front/first Node of the queue.  
*Rear* - This is the rear/last Node of the queue.  
*Peek* - When you peek you will view the value of the front Node in the queue.  
*IsEmpty* - returns true when queue is empty otherwise returns false.
