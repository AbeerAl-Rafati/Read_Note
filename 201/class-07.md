# Domain modeling  

is to create a conceptual model for a specific problem that can verify and validate the understanding of the problem.  



### tips to follow when building a domain models.  

> When modeling a single entity that'll have many instances, build self-contained objects with the same attributes and behaviors.  
> Model its attributes with a constructor function that defines and initializes properties.  
> Model its behaviors with small methods that focus on doing one job well.  
> Create instances using the new keyword followed by a call to a constructor function.  
> Store the newly created object in a variable so you can access its properties and methods from outside.  
> Use the this variable within methods so you can access the object's properties and methods from inside.
