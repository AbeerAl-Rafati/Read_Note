### Intelligence and talent is a good things, but these skilles only a starting points.

## How to keep your self in a growth mindset:

* Go through the problem once again, bit by bit, looking for new ways to think about it until I start to see another way forward.

* Use “gumption trap” when you face any problem stand up, put down whatever project is sucking the gumption out of you, walk away, and return when you’re feeling more inspired.

* Follow the life rule which says “no pain, no gain”.
