# Comparison perators:
 You can evaluate a situation by coparing one value in the script to what you expect it might be, the result will be a Boolean.

 ## Boolean:
>  `==`  : compares two values to see if they are the same.  

>  `!=`  : compares two values to see if they are not the same.  

>  `===` : compares two values to check that both the data type and value are the same.  

>  `!==` : compares two values to check that both the data and value are not the same.    

>  `>`   : checks if the number on the left is greater than the number on the right.  

>  `<`   : checks if the number on the left is less than the number on the right.  

>  `>=`  : checks if the number on the left is greater than or equal to the number on the right.  

>  `<=`  : checks if the number on the left is less than or equal to the number on the right.

# logical Operators 
Thats allow  you to compare the results of more than one comparison operator.

> `&&`  : if **both** expressions evaluate to **true** then the expression returns **true**, if **just one** of these returns **false** then the expression will return **false**.  

> `||`  : if **either** expressions evaluate to **true** then the expression returns **true**, if **both* return** **false** then the expression will return **false**.  

> `!`   : if it was **false** it would return **true**.  


-----------------------------
# loops

Which checks a condition, if it returns **true** a code block will run, then the codition will be checked again and if it still returns **true** the code block will run again, repeats until the codition returns **false**.

> `for`     : used if you need to run code, **a specific number of times.  

> `while`   : used if you do **not know how many times the code should run**.  

> `do while`: it will run the statments inside the curly braces **at least one time**.
