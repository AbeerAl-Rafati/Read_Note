# HOW HTML, CSS, & JAVASCRIPT FIT TOGETHER 

* This is where the content of
the page lives. The HTML gives
the page structure and adds
semantics. 
* The CSS enhances the HTML
page with rules that state how
the HTML content is presented
(backgrounds, borders, box
dimensions, colors, fonts, etc.). 
* This is where we can change
how the page behaves, adding
interactivity. We will aim to keep
as much of our JavaScript as
possible in separate files. 

# Basic JS instructions


### STATEMENTS
A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one.
Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement. 

### COMMENTS 
You should write comments to explain what your code does.
They help make your code easier to read and understand.
This can help you and others who read your code. 

### VARIABLE
A script will have to temporarily
store the bits of information it
needs to do its job. It can store this
data in variables.


# DATA TYPES 

* NUMERIC DATA TYPE 
> 0.75 
* STRING DATA TYPE 
> "H., Ivy!" 
* BOOLEAN DATA TYPE 
> true , false


# NAMING VARIABLES

* The name must begin with
a letter, dollar sign ($),or an
underscore (_). It must not start
with a number. 
* The name can contain letters,
numbers, dollar sign ($), or an
underscore (_). Note that you
must not use a dash(-) or a
period (.) in a variable name.
* All variables are case sensitive,
so score and Score would be
different variable names, but
it is bad practice to create two
variables that have the same
name using different cases.
* Use a name that describes the
kind of information that the
variable stores.
* If your variable name is made
up of more than one word, use a
capital letter for the first letter of
every word after the first word. 
* You cannot use keywords or
reserved words.
