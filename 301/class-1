# React  

## What Is React?  

React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called “components”.  

> `React.Component`  

* JSX : 
special syntax which makes these structures easier to write.  


* Passing props:  
is how information flows in React apps, from parents to children.    

* React components can have state by setting `this.state` in their constructors. `this.state` should be considered as private to a React component that it’s defined in.  

* In JavaScript classes, you need to always call super when defining the constructor of a subclass. All React component classes that have a constructor should start with a `super(props)` call.  

* When you call setState in a component, React automatically updates the child components inside of it too.  

* There are generally two approaches to changing data. The first approach is to mutate the data by directly changing the data’s values. The second approach is to replace the data with a new copy which has the desired changes.  

*  function components:  
are a simpler way to write components that only contain a `render` method and don’t have their own state. Instead of defining a class which extends `React.Component`, we can write a function that takes `props` as input and returns what should be rendered. Function components are less tedious to write than classes, and many components can be expressed this way.  

* Unlike the array `push()` method you might be more familiar with, the `concat()` method doesn’t mutate the original array, so we prefer it.  

* In JavaScript, arrays have a map() method that is commonly used for mapping data to other data.  


## example:

`ReactDOM.render(
  <h1>Hello, world!</h1>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);`
